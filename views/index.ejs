            <p data-aos="fade-up">Hello everyone, this is Nikhil Prakash. I am currently in my third year pursuing btech in Information Technology from BIT Mesra. This blog is my attempt to help 
                everyone in their coding preparation and related stuff. I will be providing all the resources that helped me during my time while I studied and prepared for different 
                examinations. Here by, I also admit that I am not the best coder to be guiding people and not the absolute best at what I do. This is just my way of helping fellow
                 coders so that they do not encounter the same problems I faced along the way.
