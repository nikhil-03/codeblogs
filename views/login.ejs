                I believe you learn effectively only when you discuss and share whatever you already know. Being in the phase of preparation for coding interviews and an extensive
                 placement season myself, I realised how important it is to share whatever I learn along the way. This is a stepwise approach, which according to me, would help you 
                 transition from a beginner to expert in due course of time. Nevertheless, this is something relatively new, even for me and I hope you understand that inspite of 
                 having a very tough placement season, I'll try to update the blogs from time to time. Happy learning, and all the very best.
